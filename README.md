# The NASA Space Apps Challenge

The NASA Space Apps Challenge is coming to Adelaide 23-24th April, 2016.

The [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2016](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org) is an international hackathon conducted in over 200 locations worldwide.

We invite engineers, coders, makers, artists entrepreneurs scientists and storytellers to connect over mission-related challenges, participating in NASA's Open Innovation Initiative. Together, citizens like you have developed thousands of open-source solutions. Your big ideas are shaped using data visualizations, hardware, code, design, even board games, and more!

If you are an individual thinking of [registering](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/adelaide-australia) and need help forming or joining a team, please dont hesitate to contact us, either via Twitter [@SpaceAppsAdl](https://twitter.com/SpaceAppsAdl) or via email at adlspaceapp2016 AT phaze dot space !
   
There are challenges this year in the following categories:
* [Aeronautics](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/aero),
* [Space Station](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station),
* [Solar System](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/solar-system),
* [Technology](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/tech),
* [Earth](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth),
* [Journey to Mars](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/mars)

Here in South Australia we like to put our own spin on things therefore in addition to the above, you are invited to tackle a special local challenge we have arranged in collaboration with [Associate Professor Graziella Caprarelli](http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/staff/homepage.asp?Name=Graziella.Caprarelli), co-founder of [Marvel STEM](http://www.marvelstem.org/) and the Italian Osservatorio di Radioastronomia Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica.

# Hints and Tips

Lead organiser, Andrew McDonnell (Twitter: [@pastcompute](https://twitter.com/pastcompute)) will run one (or more as needed) tutorials across weekend on the on how to use github to manage code, artwork, diagrams, etc. and on other tools you might find useful managing or creating your entry.

## MARS Australian Remote Virtual Experiment Laboratory

MARVEL ([MARS Australian Remote Virtual Experiment Laboratory](http://www.marvelstem.org/)) is a virtual laboratory for students, teachers and scientists to study and analyse real-life planetary data from Mars-orbiting satellites. It allows students and teachers to experience authentic science and simultaneously progresses scientific discoveries about Mars. The MARVEL team now wants your help to develop a citizen science app so that anyone who wishes to can participate in this voyage of discovery!

Please read the [Challenge Background sheet](ChallengeBackground.md) for an briefing on the analysis to date.

The material describing [mars express - the search for water](http://sci.esa.int/mars-express/31033-objectives/?fobjectid=31033&fbodylongid=658)
and the [mars express instrument design](http://sci.esa.int/mars-express/34826-design/?fbodylongid=1601) will also be useful.

In summary:

* MarvelSTEM is interested in analysing radargram images of Mars from the public archive of the European Space Agency, the Planetary Science Achive (PSA)
* This includes classifying the images and looking for 'subsurface' "interfaces"
* However at present the human eye is still much better than computer algorithms at this work. Even children can do it...
* MarvelSTEM would like to produce some kind of tool both educational and useful that might allow even children to participate in this classification process
* A simple software prototype has been developed, a detail description is in the [Challenge Background sheet](ChallengeBackground.md) 
* The prototype was created using the computer language 'Matlab'
* Matlab is a scientific computer langauge useful to scientists, but not suitable for use in say a website situation or a phone app.

The Matlab code is found at https://github.com/SpaceAppsAdl/SouthAustraliaChallenge2016/tree/master/MatlabCode

## MarvelSTEM Challenge Brief

To participate in this challenge, use your imagination, design, art or your coding skills to assist MarvelSTEM with the above.

One key goal is to convert the computer program into a more accessible language, for example Python.

However, if your skills are in other areas, and you wish to participate, feel free to let your imagination run - just some ideas include creating an infogram about the data, rewriting the background into a poster understandable to your children, running image classification algorithms if you are a data scientists, and so on.

# Stay Tuned

Further information, including eligibility criteria for all challenges, and local prize categories, will be annouced at kickoff.
